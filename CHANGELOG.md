# Change Log
All notable changes to the "the-one-that-aligns-columns" extension will be documented in this file.

## 0.1.0
- Added an icon
- Fixed: Don't capture rows that have anything before or after the values list, as the alignment alorithm would dispose of that text.
- Fixed: The first line in the document wasn't aligned. Not that you'd ever want to do that anyways.

## 0.0.1
- Initial release
